# moviescheckstools

Several things used to help exporting or migrating checklists when there is no API or binding.

- IMDb, TVDb, TMDb... to Trakt : https://github.com/damienhaynes/TraktRater
- Trakt.tv to icheckmovies : Trakt.tv backup + imdbify

## imdbify

Transform the JSON output given by [trakt.tv backup](http://eclectide.com/blog/2014/08/12/trakt-tv-backup/)
into a CSV similar to the one generated by the IMDb export.

This CSV may then feed a service asking for the IMDb export file (ex. icheckmovies).

Use : drop the ratings_movies.txt file generated by trakt.tv backup, and copy the resulting CSV data.

## compare

Compare the given 

Use : drop export files from IMDb, trakt.tv backup, or any list containing IMDb ID's surrounded by double quotes.

## icheckmovies export

Create a CSV export of the checked movies in icheckmovies, as a list of IMDB urls.

Import the following sitemap in [Web Scraper Extension](webscraper.io) (replace ``44`` by the number of pages in icheckmovies checked movies list), scrape (it may take more than a minute) & export CSV
````
{"startUrl":"https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/checked/?page=[1-44]","selectors":[{"parentSelectors":["_root"],"type":"SelectorElementAttribute","multiple":true,"id":"imdb_link","selector":"a.optionIMDB","extractAttribute":"href","delay":""}],"_id":"icheckmovies_checked_imdbids"}
```

By deleting the url prefix in a text editor, keeping only the IMDb ID surrounded by double quotes, the file may be dropped onto [compare](#compare).
