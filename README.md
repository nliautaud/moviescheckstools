# moviescheckstools

Several things used to help exporting or migrating checklists when there is no API or binding.

- IMDb, TVDb, TMDb... to Trakt : [TraktRater][traktrater]
- icheckmovies to trakt.tv : icheckmovie export (see below) + imdbify + [TraktRater][traktrater]
- trakt.tv to icheckmovies, criticker... : Trakt.tv backup + imdbify

## [imdbify][imdbify]

Transform the JSON output of a [trakt.tv backup][ttvbackup] or any file containing IMDb IDs into a CSV similar to the one generated by the IMDb export, to feed a service asking for the IMDb export file, for example :
- [icheckmovies.com](https://www.icheckmovies.com/import/imdbvotes/)
- [criticker.com](https://www.criticker.com/?im)

**Examples :**

To export trakt.tv data to icheckmovies, do a [trakt.tv backup][ttvbackup], convert ``watched_movies.txt`` and ``ratings_movies.txt`` with [imdbify][imdbify], and import the resulting CSVs in icheckmovies : https://www.icheckmovies.com/import/imdbvotes/.

To export trakt.tv ratings to criticker, do a [trakt.tv backup][ttvbackup], convert ``ratings_movies.txt`` with [imdbify][imdbify], and import the resulting CSV in criticker : https://www.criticker.com/?im.

## [compare](https://rawgit.com/nliautaud/moviescheckstools/master/compare.html)

Drop several export files from IMDb, trakt.tv backup, or any file containing IMDb ID's surrounded by double quotes to compare their IMDb IDs. 

## icheckmovies export

Create a CSV export of the checked movies in icheckmovies, as a list of IMDB urls.

1. Install the [Web Scraper Extension](webscraper.io) for chrome
1. Import the following sitemap (replace ``44`` by the number of pages in icheckmovies), scrape (it may take more than a minute) & export the resulting CSV file  
``{"startUrl":"https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/checked/?page=[1-44]","selectors":[{"parentSelectors":["_root"],"type":"SelectorElementAttribute","multiple":true,"id":"imdb_link","selector":"a.optionIMDB","extractAttribute":"href","delay":""}],"_id":"icheckmovies_checked_imdbids"}``
3. delete the url prefixes in the file with a text editor to keep only the IMDb ID surrounded by double quotes
4. drop the file onto [compare](#imdbify) and save the result
5. give the resulting data to [TraktRater][traktrater].

Done !
